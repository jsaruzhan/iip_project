How It Works
Core Concept
      The app uses MediaPipe's pose detection to identify key body landmarks (shoulders, hips, knees, ankles) from the camera feed. 
      Clothing images (PNGs with transparent backgrounds) are then scaled and positioned based on these landmarks to create a virtual try-on effect.
